## Huemn Interactive Assignment

## About

Huemn Interactive Assignment is a React application created to showcase interactive UI/UX features (as part of an assignment). It was bootstrapped using Create React App.

**Core Technologies:**

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We will use it to create our application's structure out of reusable, isolated pieces of code called "components."

- **SCSS (Sass):** A powerful extension of standard CSS. It will help us write more organized, reusable, and manageable styles for our components.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** A professional-grade JavaScript animation library. GSAP gives us precise control over every aspect of an animation (timing, sequencing, easing), making it the perfect tool for
  replicating the fluid and complex animations on the Chrome page.
